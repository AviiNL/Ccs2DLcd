# Ccs2DLcd

## Overview

This project is an attempt to render a 2D sprite based game on your G19 Lcd Display.


## Usage

Ccs2DLcd allows you to create your very own game that can be played on the Logitech G19 Keyboard LCD.

### Requirements

 - .NET Framework 4.0
 - Visual Studio C# 2010 Express or above

### Dependencies

 - CsLglcd<br>
 CsLglcd is a .NET wrapper for the G19 SDK
 - NAudio<br>
 NAudio is being used for.. well... audio.

All third party dependencies are included in the project,<br>
so there is no need for you to go look for them ( unless you really really want to.... you can go look them up ;) )

Ccs2DLcd is compiled using Visual Studio 2010 Express for C# with the .NET Framework 4.0.<br>

### Getting started

To use Ccs2DLcd open Visual Studio and create a new Console Application in C#<br>
You can use a windows form, but in my experience it will stay empty anyway.

Once in your project add reference to Ccs2DLcd.dll or use the project.<br>
Build it once to create output files and copy the dll.<br>
Navigate to [your project]\bin\Debug\ and copy the other dll's from [Ccs2DLcd]\bin\Debug\ or [Ccs2DLcd]\bin\Release\

Add ' using Ccs2DLcd; ' to the top of your Program.cs (or Form1.cs if using windows forms application)<br>
Now you are ready to make your own game.
